# Harmonizer
End-of-the-year Project in Télécom ParisTech

This project was made with Mathis Chagneux, Louise Loesch, Corentin Llorca and me Rehareha Ramanana. The objective was to, create a live adaptation of Jacob Collier's Harmonizer. This video, explains the whole thought process : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnpVAyPjxDA .

We used the live implementation of PSOLA (Pitch Synchronous Overlap Add) algorithm. All the comments, are however in French.
